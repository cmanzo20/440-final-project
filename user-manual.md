# **Wandering in the Woods**
Wandering in the Woods is a game simulation aimed at helping different age groups use computational thinking to understand and control randomness.
### **Objectives**
Students are tasked with watching simulations and reading assessments to understand how grid size, player count, and player position can all impact how long players spend wandering.
### **Setup**
Wandering in the Woods has three levels of complexity that can be selected by the player. For ages K-2, students press the labelled button for the simulation to begin.
For ages 3-5 and 6-8, students are given choices for grid size, number of players, and player starting position. After moving past the start screen,
students select the width and height of the grid, ranging from one to twenty spaces. They also select between two to four players. Once all items are selected, students will move on
to selecting the starting position of each player by choosing their x and y positions. Note, players may not start on the same space. Once all items are selected, the
simulation can begin. An about section is provided for students to look at for reminders of the rules.
### **Running the Simulation**
Once the size of the grid, the number of players, and the players' starting coordinates have been selected, each player icon will move across the grid in completely random directions. While this is happening, the number of player steps taken to complete the simulaton is recorded. The players continue to wander around the grid randomly until the players encounter one another. Once players are at the same coordinates at the same time, they then travel together around the grid randomly as one unit. The simulation ends once all players have reached each other at the same coordinates.
### **Assessments and Ending the Simulation**
After the simulation has finished the longest run recorded, the shortest run recorded, and the average steps per run are displayed to the screen. The player can keep replaying simulations as many times as they want and each run will be factored in when calculating the longest, shortest, and average step count per simulation recorded.

When students are finished, pressing the X button will take them back to the main menu from both the game and the setup screen. Pressing the button again will close the game entirely.
